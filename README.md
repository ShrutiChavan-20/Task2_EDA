# Task-02: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Overview
This task focuses on performing **data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand the structure of the dataset, explore relationships between variables, and identify meaningful patterns and trends.

For this task, the **Titanic dataset** was used as it is a classic dataset for understanding data analysis and feature relationships.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Name:** Titanic Dataset  
- **Source:** Kaggle / Prodigy InfoTech Sample Dataset  
- **Type:** Tabular (CSV)

The dataset includes passenger details such as age, gender, passenger class, fare, and survival status.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 🔍 Workflow

### 1. Data Loading
- Loaded the dataset using Pandas
- Checked shape, data types, and basic statistics

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values
- Removed irrelevant or redundant columns
- Ensured data consistency

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analyzed survival distribution
- Explored relationships between:
  - Gender and Survival
  - Passenger Class and Survival
  - Age distribution
  - Fare vs Survival
- Created visualizations using bar charts, histograms, and box plots

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Female passengers had a higher survival rate than males
- First-class passengers showed better survival chances
- Majority of passengers were in the 20–30 age group
- Higher fare values were generally associated with higher survival probability

---

## ✅ Conclusion
Exploratory Data Analysis helped uncover important patterns and relationships within the dataset.  
This task demonstrates how EDA is essential for understanding data before applying machine learning models.
